# A Time Tracking Program

# INTRODUCTION:
Nana is a business man who has a consultancy firm. As a result, he charges a fixed rate per hour for every task that he carries out for his clients. Nana has realised that to make his work easier, he needs a Time Tracker program that will enable him to enter the time at which he started and ended a task, and with that information calculate the amount of money he earns within that period. A program was designed by the Azubi PYG-01 team that would enable Nana to achieve this.

# PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 
The Time Tracker is both a CONSOLE BASED PROGRAM and GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI). 
It is designed to use both the system time and User inputed times
The User has an option either to use the LIVE SESSION (where he clicks the start and stop button depending on when he is done with the assignment) or 
Use the other option to calculate amount earned by entering the 
These variales (time) are then used to calculates the amount of money made in tackling the task.

# timetracker.py is the COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
# GUI.py is the Graphical USER INTERFACE of the Time tracker


# DIRECTIONS FOR THE GUI
